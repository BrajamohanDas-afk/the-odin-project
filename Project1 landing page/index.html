    This Game is Awesome
    <p>The game follows the volunteers of Expedition 33 as they set out to destroy the Paintress, a being causing the yearly Gommage, which erases those at or above an ever-decreasing age. In the game, the player controls a party of characters from a third-person perspective, exploring areas and engaging in combat.
      Coupled with its turn-based mechanics are real-time aspects such as quick time events and timed actions in combat.</p>
